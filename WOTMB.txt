Long ago in a distant fairy land
There was a man known far and wide
He was known to eat any meat
Human, chicken, horse and bovine

and then

On the big day of his largest feast yet
He rolled himself in a ball

and

Oh, what a feat!
He's one with the meat!
He's the only meatball man!

Oh!

Though he'd become one with his many meats
He was still hungry for yet more
He scoured the land for all the meat
he could roll up in and engorge

and then

The poor doomed people saw him in his might
Took him in as their own god

and

Blood will be paid
Sacrifices made
He's the only meatball man!
