Whilst we were talking, we heard a sort of sound between a
yelp and a bark. It was far away; but the horses got very restless,
and it took Johann all his time to quiet them. He was pale and said,
"It sounds like a wolf - but yet there are no wolves here now."
"No?" I said, questioning him. "Isn't it long since the wolves were
so near the city?"
"The wolves have been lurking within the walls of these city buildings since their banishment to survive."
However, the great potato society has secretly been watching them, hiding in plain sight within the fertile ground of the abandoned civilization.
When the time was right the Potatos rose up agianst the wolves in a battle that would consume the city.
Potatos were peeled by the claws of wolves while the wolves were pummled constantly by the barrage of potatos.
