Whilst we were talking, we heard a sort of sound between a
yelp and a bark. It was far away; but the horses got very restless,
and it took Johann all his time to quiet them. He was pale and said,
"It sounds like a wolf - but yet there are no wolves here now."
"No?" I said, questioning him. "Isn't it long since the wolves were
so near the city?"
"The wolves have been lurking within the walls of these city buildings since their banishment to survive."
However, the great potato society has secretly been watching them, hiding in plain sight within the fertile ground of the abandoned civilization.
When the time was right, the Potatoes rose up agianst the wolves in a battle that would consume the city.
Potatoes were peeled by the claws of wolves while the wolves were pummeled constantly by the barrage of potatoes. 
The great battallions on each side were equally matched, leaving the battle to continue for weeks past the initiation of conflict.
Then, both sides decided to develop new techniques to eliminate the enemy.
It first began with the wolves bringing grated shields to ensure that the potatoes would be damaged upon attacking.
The potatoes retaliated by freezing themselves before being hurled as ammunition to cause as much damage as possible.
However, both sides eventually realized that there was a power hidden well within the abandoned city that could end their conflict once and for all: underground nuclear power plants.
There was a race between both sides to reverse engineer all of the existing mechanisms to weaponize the immense amounts of power that they discovered the plants could make.
